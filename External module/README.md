## Wiring schema
In the following the wiring schema for External module:

![external module schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_external-module-wiring-v.2.2_2021-07-20.svg)

In the following paragraph are detailed and explained all single part of External module.

## Power system
The External Module power system core is the Adadruit Solar Charger (bq24074). It's a smart solar charger module ables to charge the 2 18650 3.7V 3400mAh Li-Ion batteries (6400mAh in parallel) using the energy producted by 6V 750ma solar panel and, at the same time, ables to powers direclty the Lilygo ESP32 microcontroller (via a HT7333 LDO). In details, the solar panel is connected to VBUS and GND pins of bq24074. This is possible because the Solar Charger accepts 4,5-10V input voltage. The bq24074 which powers this design is great for solar charging, and will automatically draw the most current possible from the panel in any light condition. Even thought it isn't a 'true' MPPT (max power point tracker), it has near-identical performance without the additional cost of a buck-converter. The batteris pack is connected to LIPO and GND pins and this will be charged by the bq24074 in smart way. Smart load sharing automatically uses the input power when available, to keep battery from constantly charging/discharging, up to 1.5A draw. The load is connected to OUT and GND pins and the load output is regulated to never be over 4,4V. All features of this module can be read here (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bq24074-universal-usb-dc-solar-charger-breakout).

Due to the load output is regulated to 4,4V and the microcontroller input power is 3,3V, a LDO regulator is connected between the Solar Charger output and the microcontroller input.

Moreover, a 2 position switch is inserted between Solar Charger and LDO so that all sensors and the microcontroller can be turned off. Note that the batteries charge circuit can never be turned off because it's before the switch.

All weather sensors are powered directly by microcontroller 3V3 and GND pins without using external voltage regulator due to all sensors required 3,3V to operate.

## External module lifetime without recharge system enabled ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-toverify-yellow)
Measuring the energy consumption of the External module using an amperometer, it has been registered that it requires about 30mA during the weather reading (setting the microcontroller CPU frequency to 26Mhz) and peaks of 130mA during the LoRa packets trasmissions.
Using this values, we can calculate the External module lifetime witout charging system enabled:

|Description|Measurement|
|--|--|
|Weather data reading|2500ms|
|LoRa trasmission|230ms|
|Weather data reading + LoRa trasmission (cicle)|about 2,8s|
|Number of cicles per hour|3600 / 2,8s = 1286 cicles|
|Current consumption per hour for weather data reading|1286 * 30mA * 2,5 / 3600 = 26,79mA|
|Current consumption per hour for LoRa trasmission|1286 * 130mA * 0,23 / 3600 = 18,90mA|
|Battery lifetime in hours|6800 / (26,79 + 18,90) = 6800 / 45,69 = 148,82 hours|
|Battery lifetime in days|148,82 / 24 = 6,2 days|

These calculations are theoretical only. There are other factors that influence the results (real battery capacity, weather conditions, etc.). **Moreover, it's very important declare that when the batteries drop below 3.65V, the External module works badly and therefore the weather data readings are no longer reliable.**
Based on these considerations it can be said that the External module, in the absence of a recharging system, is able to live for 3/4 days.

## Solar panel monitoring system
A first INA219 has been inserted between the solar panel and the Adafruit Solar Charger. This module will be able to monitor the voltage and the current producted by the solar panel. The INA219 reads this values and via i2c channel trasmits them to the microcontroller.

![INA219 solar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_INA219_solar.svg)

## Battery monitoring system ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-toverity-yellow)
A second INA219 has been inserted between the battery pack and the Adafruit Solar Charger. This module will be able to monitor the voltage and the current of the battery pack. The INA219 reads this values and via i2c channel trasmits them to the microcontroller. If the read current value is negative then the battery is in charge fase, otherwise it's in discharge fase.

![INA219 battery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_INA219_battery.svg)

## i2c communication
The i2c channel is used to permit communication between the microcontroller and the UV (VEML6075) and temperature, humidity and pressure sensors (BME280). This bus is used to INA219 communication and can be used for future purpose too, due to on PCB there are other 3 i2c sockets.

## Anemometer
The Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit cup-type anemometer, as defined in own [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/1/e/0/6/DS-15901-Weather_Meter.pdf), measures wind speed by closing a contact as a magnet moves past a switch. A wind speed of 2,401 km/h causes the switch to close once per second. The anemometer switch is connected to the inner two conductors of the RJ11 cable shared by the anemometer and wind vane (pin 2 and 3) and finally it is connected to the microcontroller via the shared wind vane RJ11. To wire the wind sensor to the microcontroller it's necessary to use a 10k ohm external resistor to avoid digital value fluctuations.

Below the detailed wiring schema including the 10k external resistor:

![anemometer wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_anemometer.svg)

The Anemometer is connected to the microcontroller digital GPIO23 and GND. After that, all we need to do then is to monitor for button presses which is pretty straightforward. We can use the pin interrupts method to monitor the button press (tips). When the reed switch closes the circuit (pressing the button), it triggers a software event (see Wind speed measurement section for software details).

## Wind vane
The Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit wind vane, as defined in own [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/1/e/0/6/DS-15901-Weather_Meter.pdf), has eight switches, each connected to a different resistor. The vaneâ€™s magnet may close two switches at once, allowing up to 16 different positions to be indicated. An external resistor shall be used to form a voltage divider, producing a voltage output that can be measured using an analog pin of microcontroller.
Resistance values for all 16 possible positions are given in the table.

|Direction(degree)|Resistor(ohm)|
|--|--|
|0|33k|
|22,5|6,57k|
|45|8,2k|
|67,5|891|
|90|1k|
|112,5|688|
|135|2,2k|
|157,5|1,41k|
|180|3,9k|
|202,5|3,14k|
|225|16k|
|247,5|14,12k|
|270|120k|
|292,5|42,12k|
|315|64,9k|
|337,5|21,88k|

Resistance values for positions between those shown in the diagram are the result of two adjacent resistors connected in parallel when the vaneâ€™s magnet activates two switches simultaneously.

The wind vane is connected to the external two conductors of the RJ11 cable shared by the anemometer and wind vane (pin 1 and 4) and finally it is connected to the microcontroller via the shared anemometer RJ11. To wire the wind vane sensor to the microcontroller it's necessary to use a 10k ohm external resistor to avoid analog value fluctuations. Below the detailed schema including the 10k external resistor:

![wind vane wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_wind-vane.svg)

The wind vane is connected to the microcontroller analog GPIO32 and GND. After that, all we need to do then is to read the GPIO analog value and convert this value in wind direction using the table defined in Wind direction measurement section (read that section for software details).

## Rain gauge
The Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit rain gauge, as defined in own [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/1/e/0/6/DS-15901-Weather_Meter.pdf), is a self-emptying tipping bucket type. Each 0.2794mm of rain cause one momentary contact closure that can be recorded with a digital counter or microcontroller interrupt input. The gaugeâ€™s switch is connected to the two center conductors of the attached RJ 11-terminated cable (pin 2 and 3). To wire the rain gauge sensor to the microcontroller it's necessary to use a 10k ohm external resistor to avoid digital value fluctuations.

Below the detailed wiring schema including the 10k external resistor:

![rain gauge wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/Schematic_rain-gauge.svg)

The rain gauge is connected to the microcontroller digital GPIO13 and GND. After that, all we need to do then is to monitor for button presses which is pretty straightforward. We can use the pin interrupts method to monitor the button press (tips). When the reed switch closes the circuit (pressing the button), it triggers a software event (see Rain measurement section for software details).

## PCB

Using the above schema and explanations, the following PCB has been created to merge all External module components:

![external module pcb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/main/External%20module/pcb-external-module/PCB_PCB_external-module-wiring-v.2.2-2021-07-27.svg)

## Software description
The External module source code is uploaded in [firmware-external-module](https://github.com/pasgabriele/lora-weather-station/tree/main/External%20module/firmware-external-module) folder.
The code has been written using [Visul Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [PlatformIO plugin](https://platformio.org/), therefore you can clone this repository directly on the above plaftorm.

All weather data read from sensors are processed by the External module, inserted in json string (for example `{"id":3908,"supplyVoltage":3.747275,"outTemp":26.61,"outHumidity":49.11914,"pressure":935.8403,"windSpeed":0,"windDir":157.5,"UV":0}`) and send, via LoRa wireless communication (433Mhz), to the Gateway.

The External module is fully self powered via 2 li-ion 18650 batteries and a solar panel charger. The External module has been projected to work as following:

- reads sensors values
- composes the json string
- sends the json string to Gateway

and repeat the cicle approximately every 2.8 seconds.

No Deep Sleep mode has been enable. In this way the weather data is captured in real time. This is important specially for wind speed and direction and rain accumulation.

## Temperature, humidity and pressure measurement
The temperature, humidity and pressure measurement is provided by BME280 sensor. In the setup function the BME280 sensor is initilizated using the function BMEInitialization(). If the initialization is ok then, in the loop, the BMEReading() reads the temperature, humidity and pressure data and inserts them in the BMETemperature, BMEHumidity and BMEPressure variables. These will used to compose the json string.

## UV index measurement
The UV index measurement is provided by VEML6075 sensor. In the setup function the VEML6075 sensor is initilizated using the function UVInitialization(). If the initialization is ok then, in the loop, the UVReading() reads the UV index data and inserts it in the UVIndex variables. This will used to compose the json string.

## Wind speed measurement
The wind speed measurement is derived by: (http://cactus.io/hookups/weather/anemometer/davis/hookup-arduino-to-davis-anemometer-wind-speed).

It works as following: 

As describe in Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit datasheet, a wind speed of 2.401km/h causes the switch to close once per second, then the wind speed measurement can be executed counting the numbers of switch closed in a sample time. Therefore, when the External module executes the windSpeedReading() function, it actives the pulses measurement (activating the interrupt) for 2,401 seconds (sample window for wind measurement), then stops the pulses measurement (disabling the interrupt), calculates the wind speed in this 2,401 seconds window and stores this value in the windSpeed variable. This will used to compose the json string.

## Wind direction measurement
The wind direction measurement is provided by windDirectionReading() function. It reads the analog value from the PIN connected to the Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit Wind Vane component (using the 10k ohm resistor) and converts this raw value in wind direction degree. As describe in the datasheet, a specified voltage value maps a specific wind direction. Therefore the windDirectionReading() function maps the analog raw value to wind direction and return this in degrees value. The analog value is a AVG on 50 consecutive reads. This degree value is stored in the windDir variable and it will used to compose the json string. 

## Rain measurement ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-todo-red)
~~The rain measurement is provided by rainReading function. As describe in Spurkfun Weather Meter Kit datasheet, every 0.2794mm of rain causes the switch to close once, then the rain measurement can be executed counting the numbers of switch closed. Due to the External Module go to sleep for a defined time, is necessary to count the rain switch close during the normal mode and during the sleep mode too. To do this, there are 2 different counters:~~
~~- rainCounterDuringSleep~~
~~- rainCounterDuringActive~~

~~It works as following:~~

~~During the normal mode, at startup time, a interrupt function to monitor the rain switch close is enabled. If a rain switch close is detected, the interrupt function increments the rainCounterDuringActive counter, then, when the rainReading function is called, it uses the counter to calculate the rain amount.~~

~~Instead, during the sleep mode, the External module monitors the rain GPIO and if it detects a rain switch close, wake-up the External module, increases the rainCounterDuringSleep counter and executes the normal mode above described.~~

## Battery voltage measurement ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-todo-red)
~~As already mentioned the voltages on GPIO33 shifts between 0 and 3,3 volts then between 0 and 4095 values (the ADC pin has 12bit resolution), so we can establish a constant to calculate the voltage applied to the pin based on its value. This constant, theoretically, will be c = 3,3 / 4095 = 0,000805860805861. As we are applying a voltage divider and the voltage applied to the pin is half the voltage of the battery, our constant should be c = 0,000805860805861 * 2 = 0,001611721611722. This means, for each unit in ADC pin we have 0,001611721611722 Volts applied to it.~~

~~For example, if the read value on ADC pin is 2320, then the voltage applied to the pin should be VBatt = 2320 * 0,001611721611722 = 3,74V~~

~~ADC pins are not that precise, so the value of our constant should be adjusted to a level we consider it is valid for our components. In my case, after doing some testings I have concluded that the best value for the conversion factor is **0.001715**.~~

~~sources: https://www.pangodream.es/esp32-getting-battery-charging-level and https://www.settorezero.com/wordpress/arduino-nano-33-iot-wifi-ble-e-imu/~~


~~The battery voltage measurement is provided by batteryLevel() function. It reads the analog value from the PIN connected to battery and converts this raw value in voltage measurement using the above conversion factor. The analog value is a AVG on 50 consecutive reads.~~

~~The voltage measurement is stored in the volt variable and it will used to compose the json string.~~

## Json string creation and LoRa sending
When all weather data have been read, these are inserted in a json string using the composeJson() function, then the string is sent to the Gateway using LoRaSend(String packet) function via LoRa connection. After sending the string, the External module restart the cicle.
